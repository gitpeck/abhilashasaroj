### VISSIM Tutorials - Active Project (In Progress)
Role: Self-initiated

#### Project Brief
I plan to develop small size tutorials to learn using PTV's VISSIM traffic simulation software. More specifically, the tutorials will focus on using VISSIM's COM feature to apply dynamic changes in simulation runs. In graduate school, it was hard for me to learn to use COM feature and play with simulation models as beginner programmer and VISSIM software user. I hope these small size tutorials give you a good headstart in modelling dynamic control in VISSIM. 

#### Tutorial 1: Get started with VISSIM COM in Python and change volume input to links dynamically via COM
This tutorial contains a sampe Vissim network file that has one four-way signalized intersection. A COM python script is written to add vehicle inputs to the Eastbound, Westbound, Northbound, and SOuthbound links of the network while the simulation is in progress (dynamically). In addition, an instruction sheet is provided that lists the very basic steps on running the python script to start the simulation. 

Find the Vissim netwok file (sample_network1.inpx), instructions to run the model (Vissim_COM_Code_to_change_volume dynamically_readme.docx), and Vissim COM python script (script1.0.py) for this tutorial at this [github repository link](https://github.com/abhilashasaroj/VISSIM_COM_Tutorials/tree/main/Tutorial_1). The Vissim file and code provided is for Vissim 2021. 

#### Next Up - Tutorial 2: Dynamic control of signal heads via COM
